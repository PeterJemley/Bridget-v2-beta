# Multi‑Path, Probability‑Weighted Traffic Prediction — Implementation Status

*Updated: August 28, 2025*

A comprehensive status report of the Multi‑Path system implementation, showing completed phases, current progress, and next steps.

---

## Core Philosophy
- Start small: Built on tiny subgraph (3–5 nodes, 2–4 bridges) with deterministic fixtures
- Use synthetic data: Validated with deterministic/mock predictor first
- Iterate in layers: Enumerate → ETA → features → predict (batch) → score → aggregate
- Checkpoint rigor: Each phase has Purpose / Acceptance / Known Limits

---

## Invariants & Implementation Rules - ALL IMPLEMENTED

- [x] 1. Advance ETA on every edge
   - Always increment currentTime for each traversed edge (regardless of bridge)
   - Ensures ETA at each bridge is accurate

- [x] 2. Network probability uses union, not sum
   - For path success probabilities p_i (assumed independent):
   ```
   let anyPathOK = 1.0 - scoredPaths.map { 1.0 - $0.probability }.reduce(1.0, *)
   ```

- [x] 3. Log‑domain aggregation + clamping (numerical stability)
   ```
   let lo = 0.05, hi = 0.99
   let logP = bridgeProbs.map { min(max($0, lo), hi) }.map(log).reduce(0, +)
   let pathProb = exp(logP)
   ```

- [x] 4. Canonical time units
   - All durations are TimeInterval (seconds). Use Edge.travelSeconds only

- [x] 5. Strong typing & adjacency integrity
   - Use NodeID: Hashable and build adjacency in Graph initializer from allEdges to avoid drift

- [x] 6. Bidirectionality is explicit
   - Two‑way roads are two directed edges. Never assume symmetry

- [x] 7. Seeded mocks & batch prediction
   - Mocks accept a seeded PRNG; implement predictBatch now to mirror Core ML later

- [x] 8. ETA windows (future‑proof)
   - Estimator supports mean and uncertainty summaries; windows are represented via ETAWindow

- [x] 9. Acceptance guards & known limits
   - All probabilities ∈ [0,1]. Document independence assumption; shared‑bridge dependencies are a known limitation

---

- **Production-Ready Baseline**: Can replace mock predictor in production immediately
- **Real Data Foundation**: Full Seattle dataset enables realistic performance testing
- **ML Integration Path**: Clear path from baseline to ML model predictions
- **Scalable Architecture**: Thread-safe, cached, and configurable system

**High-Level Priorities (in order):**
1. **Lock down reproducible Seattle network dataset** (static first, then live augmentations)
2. **Wire dataset into existing abstractions** without breaking tests
3. **Add observability and profiling hooks** to quantify performance at scale
4. **Prepare ML feature contracts** and incremental model path (baseline → calibrated → ML)

**Concrete Implementation Plan:**

#### A) Data Model and Adapters
- [x] **Define canonical Graph import format**
  - Nodes: `id`, `lat/lon`, `type` (bridge/road), `metadata` (name, district)
  - Edges: `from`, `to`, `baseTravelTimeSec`, `allowedModes`, `isBridge`, `bridgeID?`, `laneCount`, `speedLimit`, `weight`
  - Bridges: `id`, `name`, `operating schedule metadata` (optional), `open/close constraints` (if known)
- [x] **Build GraphImporter**
  - CSV/JSON → Domain Graph (in-memory graph type used by PathEnumerationService)
  - Validate: connectivity, acyclicity constraints, edge directionality, duplicate IDs, isolated subgraphs
- [x] **Add GraphRegistry/GraphProvider**
  - Swap current test graphs with "SeattleGraphProvider" while keeping protocol identical
- [x] **Create dataset fixtures**
  - `seattle_nodes.json`, `seattle_edges.json`, `seattle_bridges.json` under TestResources
  - "Mini-Seattle" subset (5–10 bridges, 50–200 nodes) for fast unit tests
  - "Full-Seattle" dataset (thousands of nodes/edges) for performance tests

#### B) Traffic and ETA Scaffolding
- [ ] **Extend ETAEstimator to accept traffic profiles**
  - Interface: `ETAEstimator.estimateBridgeETAsWithIDs(for:departureTime:profile:)`
  - `TrafficProfile`: per time-of-day multiplier by edge/segment class (arterial, highway, local), weekend/weekday toggles
- [ ] **Build BasicTrafficProfileProvider**
  - Static profiles: rush hour multipliers (morning/evening), weekend reduced multipliers
  - Plug into ETAEstimator so current scoring pipeline benefits without code churn

#### C) Bridge Predictor Contracts and Offline Baseline
- [x] **Define HistoricalBridgeDataProvider protocol**
  - `getOpenRate(bridgeID: DateBucket)` → `(p5, p30, lastSeen, sampleCount)`
  - `DateBucket`: 5-minute bucket index + weekday/weekend flag to match 5-minute caching buckets
- [x] **Implement BaselinePredictor adapter for BridgeOpenPredictor**
  - If historical data exists: use calibrated rates (e.g., Beta prior smoothing)
  - Else: fall back to current `defaultProbability`
- [x] **Add calibration**
  - Beta smoothing: `p = (openCount + α) / (total + α + β)`, with α, β configurable in MultiPathConfig
  - Extend `config.scoring` with `priorAlpha/priorBeta`

#### D) Observability and Performance
- [ ] **Measurement hooks**
  - Add lightweight timers around:
    - Path enumeration (DFS/Yen) per request
    - ETA estimation
    - Predictor batch calls
    - PathScoringService.scorePath
  - Aggregate into `ScoringMetrics` struct and print/export to CSV in Debug builds
  - Reuse existing `PipelinePerformanceLogger` patterns and `os_signpost` for consistency
- [ ] **Memory and cache introspection**
  - Expose feature cache stats (already have `getCacheStatistics`)
  - Add periodic log with hitRate and cache size under heavy workloads
- [ ] **Performance tests**
  - New Swift Testing suite: `SeattlePerformanceTests`
  - Scenarios:
    - 5 representative OD pairs: residential→downtown, east→west across Ship Canal, SODO→Ballard, UW→West Seattle, Queen Anne→Capitol Hill
    - Compare DFS vs Yen for k = 5, 10, 20
    - Record: enumeration time, total paths, scoring time, total time, memory high-water

#### E) Data Quality and Validation
- [ ] **Graph validators**
  - Ensure every `isBridge` edge has valid `bridgeID` in bridges.json
  - Ensure no dangling `bridgeID` references
  - Ensure travel times are positive and reasonable bounds enforced
- [ ] **Sanity dashboards** (simple prints or tiny command-line tool)
  - Node/edge counts, bridge counts, average degree, largest connected component size
  - Average path length between OD samples

#### F) ML Model Integration Roadmap (Non-blocking, Incremental)
- [ ] **Freeze feature vector contract**
  - Document fixed order and meaning of features produced by `PathScoringService.buildFeatures`
  - Provide `FeatureSchema.json` versioned with checksum for training-serving parity
  - Note: Feature order matches `FeatureEngineeringService.cyc` encoding and `BridgeFeatures` mapping
- [ ] **Create dataset generator job**
  - Given historical logs (or synthetic for now), output rows: `bridgeID`, `timestamp bucket`, `feature vector`, `label` (open/closed), `weight`
- [ ] **Baseline → ML**
  - Start with baseline (calibrated rates)
  - Train simple logistic regression or gradient boosting on same features
  - Wrap trained model with `BridgeOpenPredictor` implementation supporting `predictBatch`
- [ ] **A/B switch**
  - Add `config.predictionMode`: `baseline | mlModel`
  - Ensure fallbacks if model fails or is missing for subset of bridges

#### G) Risk Management and Rollout
- [ ] **Fallback behavior**
  - If `HistoricalBridgeDataProvider` has sparse data for bridge, blend: `p = λ p_hist + (1-λ) p_baseline` with λ based on sample size
- [ ] **Robustness**
  - Keep clamping probabilities (already implemented)
  - Keep unsupported bridge handling and logging (already present)
- [ ] **Reproducibility**
  - Seeded random for synthetic features is good; ensure disabled/replaced when real data arrives
  - Version and snapshot graph datasets with manifest (dataset version, source links, generation date)

**Suggested Small Refactors:**
- **PathScoringService**
  - Add dependency injection points: `HistoricalBridgeDataProvider?` and `TrafficProfileProvider?`
  - Add `PredictionMode` enum to toggle baseline vs ML
  - Extend configuration: `scoring.priorAlpha/priorBeta`, `performance.enableMetricsLogging`
  - Expose public method to dump metrics and cache stats after batch runs

**Deliverables by End of Phase 11:**
- **Data**: `seattle_nodes.json`, `seattle_edges.json`, `seattle_bridges.json` (plus Mini-Seattle versions), `TrafficProfile` fixtures
- **Code**: Importer + validators, `HistoricalBridgeDataProvider` (file-backed), `BaselinePredictor` with Beta smoothing, extended `ETAEstimator`, performance test suite and metrics logging
- **Docs**: Data Integration Architecture doc, `FeatureSchema.json` and contract notes, benchmark report

**Expected Impact:** High - Essential for production value and accuracy

    - `nodes.json`: `[{ id, name, latitude, longitude, type }]`
    - `edges.json`: `[{ from, to, travelTimeSec, distanceM, isBridge, bridgeID }]`
    - `bridges.json`: `[{ id, name, latitude, longitude, schedule?, notes? }]`
  - **Manifest file** with dataset version/date/source URLs under TestResources

**2. Importer + Validators**
- **Goal**: Transform JSON data into domain Graph objects with validation
- **Action**: Implement GraphImporter with comprehensive validation
- **Deliverables**:
  - **GraphImporter**: JSON → Graph (pure, synchronous) with validation
