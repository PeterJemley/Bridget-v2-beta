	•	Protocols.swift Creation: Create a new file named Protocols.swift to house all progress, status, and error reporting delegate protocols for the ML pipeline.
	•	MLTypes.swift Creation: Create a new file named MLTypes.swift to house all shared, foundational types, error enums, and “shape” constants used throughout the ML pipeline.
	•	Stabilize Shapes: Write constants for feature dimension, target dimension, and horizon list in MLTypes.swift.
	•	File Organization: Move progress and status delegate protocols to `Protocols.swift`, and foundational structs/enums to `MLTypes.swift`.
	•	Code Usage Update: Replace references in other modules with imports of `Protocols.swift` and `MLTypes.swift`, and replace duplicated literal constants with shared constants.
	•	Documentation: Add documentation to `Protocols.swift` and `MLTypes.swift` to indicate that updates to shapes/horizons should be reflected throughout the pipeline.
	•	Training Progress Delegate Protocol: Defines methods for reporting training progress, completion, failure, pipeline start, data processing, training start, training completion, and pipeline completion.
	•	Feature Engineering Progress Delegate Protocol: Defines methods for reporting feature engineering start, horizon processing, completion, and failure.
	•	ML Constants: Specifies the feature dimension as 12 and the target dimension as 1.
	•	Default Horizons: An array of integers representing default horizon values: [0, 3, 6, 9, 12].
	•	Data Models: Includes `FeatureVector`, `ModelValidationResult`, `CoreMLError`, `DataValidationResult`, and `ProbeTickRaw`.
	•	Model Validation Result: Provides information about the validation of a trained model.



After reviewing the latest version of PipelineParityValidatorTests.swift􀰓, here’s what I found:

⸻

Compliance with Apple Testing Framework

• Test Structure:
All tests are contained in an @Suite with the name "Pipeline Parity Validator Tests".

• Assertion Style:
Most assertions use #expect(...), which is the correct approach for the Apple Testing framework.

• Test Discovery:
All tests meant for execution are annotated with @Test and have descriptive names.
Functions not intended as tests (helpers, setup, etc.) are not annotated.

• No XCTest Remnants:
The file does not import or use XCTest or its assertion methods.

• Async/Throws Support:
Functions are properly marked with async throws as needed, matching their behavior.

⸻

Verdict

Your PipelineParityValidatorTests.swift􀰓 file is fully compliant with the Apple Testing framework and ready for use.
All tests will be properly discovered and executed by the Swift Testing runner, and the assertion style is modern and consistent.
