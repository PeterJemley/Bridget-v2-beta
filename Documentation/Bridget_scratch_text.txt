Back to the fixed UI problems momentarily: 
What we've changed and why it helps —
1. ContentView.swift􀰓
• You kept a single NavigationStack at the root and used a single ScrollView for the dashboard-like layout. This is fine for a landing page.
• You explicitly removed .navigationBarHidden(true), which restores proper safe area handling and default insets. This is a frequent culprit for interactive area issues near the bottom.
• You added a reasonable bottom padding (.padding(.bottom, 40)) to ensure scrollable content clears any bottom bars/safe-area insets.
• You used sheet modifiers for presenting subviews, which do not interfere with hit testing of the underlying content.

Potential minor improvement:
• Consider using .safeAreaInset(edge: .bottom) instead of a fixed bottom padding if the bottom spacing needs to adapt to dynamic safe area sizes (e.g., different devices). Not necessary, but more robust.


2. RouteListView.swift􀰓
• You removed any outer ScrollView and rely solely on a single List for the scrollable content. This is the biggest fix — nested scroll containers often cause the lower half to stop receiving touches or feel “stuck.”
• The header is implemented as the first row (listHeaderRow) with clear background and custom insets, which avoids sticky headers and works well with List’s scrolling.
• Loading, error, and empty states are centered VStacks without ScrollView, which prevents accidental nested scrolling during those states.
• NavigationStack is used consistently — good for predictable safe area behavior.
• .listStyle(.insetGrouped) is appropriate and doesn’t interfere with bottom hit testing.
• You avoided overlays and .ignoresSafeArea here — also good.

Potential minor improvements:
• If you see any row selection highlight “sticking” due to the custom selection, you could switch from onTapGesture to a NavigationLink to a details view (if/when you have one). Not required for your current UI, just a UX note.
• If you need a floating banner or non-sticky section above the List, .safeAreaInset(edge: .top) can be a good alternative to a first-row header. Your current approach is valid and simple.

3. BridgetApp.swift􀰓
• AppLifecycleObserver uses Color.clear and only sets up notification tasks. This overlay does not capture touches and should not block interactions. It’s appropriately lightweight.
• No use of .ignoresSafeArea or full-screen overlays here that would affect input.
• Background task scheduling and notifications are unrelated to layout and look fine.

Potential polish:
• You might consider putting the AppLifecycleObserver in the background using .overlay(alignment: .topLeading) to make its intention explicit, but functionally what you have is fine as Color.clear does not interfere.
