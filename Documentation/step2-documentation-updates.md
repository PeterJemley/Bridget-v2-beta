- ✅ Added new test suites and test data generation
- ✅ Updated deterministic processing description
- ✅ Enhanced test coverage section
- ✅ Added large dataset testing details

### 2. **Documentation/contracts.md**
**Updates Made**:
- ✅ Enhanced API contracts description for FeatureEngineeringService
- ✅ Updated pipeline stages to reflect pure, stateless, validated processing

### 3. **Bridget/Services/FeatureEngineeringService.swift**
**Updates Made**:
- ✅ Updated completion date to August 21, 2025
- ✅ Added enhancement note about stateless validation and comprehensive testing
- ✅ Enhanced key features list with new capabilities
- ✅ Updated function documentation to reflect stateless nature

### 4. **BridgetTests/FeatureEngineeringTests.swift**
**Updates Made**:
- ✅ Updated completion date to August 21, 2025
- ✅ Added enhancement note about large dataset testing and validation helper testing

## Key Documentation Improvements

### **Enhanced Service Description**
- **Before**: "Deterministic feature generation with configurable seed"
- **After**: "Pure, stateless, deterministic feature generation with comprehensive validation"

### **Updated Test Coverage**
- **Before**: Basic golden sample and edge case testing
- **After**: Comprehensive testing including large datasets, validation helpers, and deterministic behavior verification

### **Improved Validation Documentation**
- **Before**: Private validation functions
- **After**: Internal, testable validation functions with direct test coverage

### **Enhanced Deterministic Behavior**
- **Before**: Seed-based deterministic processing
- **After**: Truly stateless processing with seed independence verified

## Documentation Accuracy

All documentation now accurately reflects:
- ✅ Truly stateless feature generation (no global state modifications)
- ✅ Comprehensive validation with zero NaNs/Inf guarantee
- ✅ Thread-safe and concurrent-ready design
- ✅ Extensive test coverage with large datasets
- ✅ Validation helper function testability
- ✅ Deterministic behavior verification

## Integration with Overall Project

The updated documentation maintains consistency with:
- ✅ Step 1 contracts and policies
- ✅ Pipeline architecture and design principles
- ✅ Testing standards and coverage requirements
- ✅ Error handling and validation strategies

## Next Steps

The documentation is now current and ready to support:
- ✅ Step 3: Data Validation Module development
- ✅ Step 4: Training Orchestration implementation
- ✅ Future enhancements and maintenance
- ✅ Team onboarding and knowledge transfer
