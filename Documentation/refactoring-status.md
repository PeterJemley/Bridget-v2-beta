# Bridget ML Pipeline Refactoring Status

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of the ML pipeline refactoring initiative, which aims to decompose the monolithic TrainPrepService into focused, testable modules with clear separation of concerns.

## Completed Refactoring Items

### âœ… 1. Protocols & Types Carve-Out (COMPLETE)
**Completion Date**: August 17, 2025  
**Status**: All requirements implemented and tested

**What Was Accomplished**:
- **`Protocols.swift`**: Centralized all ML pipeline progress/status/error reporting protocols
  - `TrainPrepProgressDelegate`
  - `CoreMLTrainingProgressDelegate` 
  - `FeatureEngineeringProgressDelegate`
  - `BridgeEventPersistenceServiceProtocol`
- **`MLTypes.swift`**: Centralized all shared ML types and constants
  - `FeatureVector`, `ProbeTickRaw`, `DataValidationResult`, `ModelValidationResult`
  - `CoreMLError`, `PipelineOperation`, `PipelineHealthIssue`, `NotificationType`
  - Constants: `featureDimension`, `targetDimension`, `defaultHorizons`
  - Enhanced `DataValidationResult` with comprehensive validation tracking

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `Bridget/Models/Protocols.swift` (NEW)
- `Bridget/Models/MLTypes.swift` (NEW)
- Updated all consuming services to use centralized types

**Dependencies Resolved**: All ML pipeline services now import from centralized type definitions

### âœ… 2. Feature Engineering Module (COMPLETE)
**Completion Date**: August 17, 2025  
**Status**: All requirements implemented and tested

**What Was Accomplished**:
- **`FeatureEngineeringService.swift`**: Pure, stateless feature generation service
  - `makeFeatures(from:horizons:)` function for deterministic feature extraction
  - Helper functions: `cyc()`, `rollingAverage()`, `dayOfWeek()`, `minuteOfDay()`
  - Direct MLMultiArray output (no CSV intermediate)
  - Configurable horizons and deterministic seed support
- **`FeatureEngineeringTests.swift`**: Comprehensive unit test coverage
  - Golden sample validation
  - Edge cases: missing ticks, single bridge, DST boundaries
  - Helper function testing

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `Bridget/Services/FeatureEngineeringService.swift` (REFACTORED)
- `BridgetTests/FeatureEngineeringTests.swift` (ENHANCED)

**Dependencies**: Uses types from Step 1 (Protocols & Types)

---

### âœ… 3. Data Validation Module (COMPLETE)
**Completion Date**: August 17, 2025  
**Status**: All requirements implemented and tested

**What Was Accomplished**:
- **`DataValidationService.swift`**: Comprehensive data validation service
  - **Public API**: `validate(ticks:)` and `validate(features:)` functions
  - **ProbeTickRaw Validation**:
    - Range checks (bridge IDs, open labels, cross ratios)
    - Timestamp monotonicity and time span analysis
    - Missing data detection (nulls, NaNs, infinities)
    - Horizon coverage analysis
    - Outlier detection using IQR method
  - **FeatureVector Validation**:
    - Range validation for cyclical and probability features
    - Completeness checks (no NaNs/infinities)
    - Horizon distribution validation
  - **Enhanced DataValidationResult**:
    - Comprehensive error and warning tracking
    - Data quality metrics aggregation
    - Detailed validation summaries

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `Bridget/Services/DataValidationService.swift` (NEW)
- `BridgetTests/DataValidationTests.swift` (NEW)
- Enhanced `Bridget/Models/MLTypes.swift` with `DataQualityMetrics`

**Dependencies**: Uses types from Step 1, validates outputs from Step 2

## Pending Refactoring Items

### ðŸ”„ 4. Core ML Training Module (PENDING)
**Status**: Not yet started  
**Dependencies**: Steps 1-3 must be complete

**Planned Scope**:
- Extract CoreML training logic into dedicated module
- Implement model training and validation
- Add performance monitoring and optimization
- Maintain interface compatibility with existing pipeline

---

## Build Status
- **Last Build**: âœ… SUCCESS (August 17, 2025)
- **Target**: iPhone 16 Pro Simulator
- **Configuration**: Debug
- **Issues**: None

## Next Phase Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Data Validation Module** - âœ… **COMPLETE**
2. **Core ML Training Module** - Extract training logic while maintaining interface compatibility

### Future Considerations
- Integration testing between all modules
- Performance benchmarking
- Documentation updates for new architecture

## Success Metrics

### Code Quality
- **Separation of Concerns**: âœ… Achieved through module decomposition
- **Testability**: âœ… Each module has comprehensive unit tests
- **Maintainability**: âœ… Clear interfaces and centralized types

### Architecture Goals
- **Modularity**: âœ… Services are focused and single-purpose
- **Reusability**: âœ… Types and protocols are shared across modules
- **Extensibility**: âœ… New validation rules or feature engineering can be added easily

### Testing Coverage
- **Golden Samples**: âœ… All modules tested with realistic data
- **Edge Cases**: âœ… DST boundaries, missing data, outliers covered
- **Error Conditions**: âœ… Comprehensive error handling and validation

---

## Technical Debt & Notes

### Resolved Issues
- âœ… Duplicate type definitions eliminated
- âœ… Hardcoded constants centralized
- âœ… Test files moved to correct target
- âœ… Import statements cleaned up

### Current Architecture Benefits
- **Type Safety**: Centralized types prevent inconsistencies
- **Test Isolation**: Each module can be tested independently
- **Clear Dependencies**: Explicit import relationships
- **Maintainable**: Changes to shapes/horizons update throughout pipeline
