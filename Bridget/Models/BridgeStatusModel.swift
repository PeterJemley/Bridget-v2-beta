//
//  BridgeStatusModel.swift
//  Bridget
//
//  Purpose: Historical bridge opening data model with caching support
//  Dependencies: Foundation (Date, TimeInterval), Observation framework
//  Integration Points:
//    - Used by BridgeDataService to represent historical bridge opening records
//    - Used by RouteModel to compose routes with historical bridge data
//    - Used by views for displaying historical bridge opening information
//    - Future: Will integrate with real-time bridge status (if available)
//  Key Features:
//    - Codable conformance for JSON caching of historical data
//    - Custom CodingKeys for JSON serialization of historical records
//    - Maintains @Observable compliance for reactive UI updates
//    - Historical analysis capabilities for past opening patterns
//    - Cache metadata for offline support of historical data
//
