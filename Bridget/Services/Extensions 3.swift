// MARK: - Custom Type Example (Placeholder)

// WARNING: Errors such as 'FeatureVector has no member day_sin/hour_sin/etc.' are NOT caused by this file.
// Those errors mean that code elsewhere is referencing missing properties or trying to assign to computed properties.
// Check MLTypes.swift for the correct field names on FeatureVector, DataValidationResult, etc.
// This file contains ONLY common Swift extensions for discoverability and maintainability.

// Example (commented-out) for domain extension:
// public extension FeatureVector {
//     /// Returns the L2 norm of the feature vector.
//     /// - Returns: The Euclidean length (L2 norm) of the vector.
//     // var l2Norm: Double {
//     //     sqrt(self.featureValues.map { $0 * $0 }.reduce(0.0, +))
//     // }
// }
