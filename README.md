## Core Engineering Requirements Synopsis

- [x] Use Apple's Observation framework exclusively (`@Observable`, `withObservationTracking`)
- [x] Fully leverage Apple macros (`@Observable`, `@ObservationIgnored`, etc.)
- [x] Integrate non-real-time bridge opening data (Seattle Open Data API)
- [x] Integrate real-time slowdown data (from Apple Maps, processed via Core ML + ANE)
- [x] Perform inference on-device using Core ML + Neural Engine
- [x] Ensure strict modularity, favoring decomposition over co-located logic
- [x] All updates to data must reactively update the UI

## Observation-First SwiftData App Architecture: Engineering Standards & Checklist

### Observation Framework Compliance
- [x] All observable types use @Observable macro (never manual Observable conformance)
- [x] All views use @Bindable for state passed from models
- [x] Any derived view-specific state is wrapped in @ObservationIgnored to prevent redundant observation
- [x] withObservationTracking is used in performance-sensitive areas with custom onChange closures
- [x] No use of @StateObject, @ObservedObject, or Combine-based publishers
- [x] All app state is stored in @Observable types, not @State or @EnvironmentObject

### Apple Macro Usage
- [x] All models use @Observable macro instead of protocol conformance
- [x] Use @ObservationIgnored for non-reactive properties (e.g. timestamps, caches)
- [x] No Apple macro is used outside of its intended context (e.g. @ObservationTracked only used by system)
- [x] No redundant manual observation registration (e.g., ObservationRegistrar) unless low-level tuning is necessary

### Data Integration (Non-Real-Time)
- [x] Non-live data (Seattle Open Data API) is fetched asynchronously and decoded into @Observable models
- [x] Bridge openings are pre-processed (e.g., grouped by time, bridge ID, or frequency buckets)
- [x] Data ingestion logic is encapsulated in a dedicated, testable service (e.g., BridgeDataService)
- [x] Models only expose data needed by the view — heavy computation or preprocessing is offloaded
- [x] HTTP requests and parsing do not occur in any view or model directly

### Real-Time Data Integration + Core ML
- [x] Real-time traffic slowdowns are collected from Apple Maps API or similar endpoint
- [x] Data is converted to model-compatible input (e.g., MLMultiArray)
- [x] Inference runs on-device using MLModelConfiguration(computeUnits: .all) (for ANE support)
- [x] Core ML output is immediately reflected in @Observable models (e.g., realTimeDelay)
- [x] No model inference occurs in the view layer or @Observable model initializers

### Inference + ANE Optimization
- [x] ML model is quantized (e.g., 16-bit or 8-bit if possible)
- [x] Model input preprocessing and output postprocessing are offloaded to TrafficInferenceService
- [x] Large batch inference uses vectorized input instead of sequential requests
- [x] Matrix and tensor operations use Accelerate, BNNS, or custom utilities where appropriate
- [x] All inference computations are tested offline and evaluated for latency on-device

### Modular Structure
- [x] All functionality is encapsulated in dedicated modules (views, services, models, utils, etc.)
- [x] No service or model file is longer than ~200 LOC without clear justification
- [x] Views do not include API requests, ML logic, or scoring logic
- [x] Scoring logic (e.g., route ranking) is in a dedicated service (e.g., RouteScoringService)
- [x] All logic can be tested in isolation from the UI layer
- [x] Global state (e.g., AppStateModel) is the only shared object passed down hierarchies
- [x] Shared dependencies (e.g., services) are injected, not hardcoded

### UI Reactivity and Responsiveness
- [x] Every data change in a model is reflected in the view via @Bindable
- [x] Long-running tasks (e.g., API calls, inference) update isLoading states in a model
- [x] Views adapt instantly when @Observable state updates
- [x] UI never blocks during data updates (async tasks properly detached)
- [x] Complex views (e.g., map) isolate sub-observation to avoid full redraws
- [x] Skeleton views, loading indicators, and placeholders are driven by observable booleans

### Code Hygiene and Evaluation Strategy
- [x] Each Swift file starts with a file-level comment identifying its module purpose and integration points
- [x] Every service has a minimal public API and is internal by default
- [x] All async tasks use Task {} or async let — no background threads directly spawned
- [x] View structs are < 150 LOC and split into subviews where possible
- [x] Every model and service is covered by a minimal unit test scaffold
- [x] All bridge and route updates are logged (in dev builds) with timestamps and route IDs

### Summary View (for integration into repo or project README)

#### Engineering Lint Summary

- [x] Observation Framework Used Exclusively
- [x] Apple Macros Fully Leveraged
- [x] Non-Real-Time Data Integrated via Decoupled Service
- [x] Real-Time Inference Performed On-Device via ANE
- [x] ML Inference and Matrix Computation Modularized
- [x] Strict Modularity Maintained Across Codebase
- [x] All UI Fully Reactive to Observed Data Changes

## Observation Framework Usage

### 1. Define Reactive State Models

```swift
@Observable
class BridgeStatusModel {
    var bridgeName: String
    var historicalOpenings: [Date]
    var realTimeDelay: TimeInterval? // computed from ML

    init(bridgeName: String, historicalOpenings: [Date]) {
        self.bridgeName = bridgeName
        self.historicalOpenings = historicalOpenings
    }
}

@Observable
class RouteModel {
    var routeID: String
    var bridgeStatuses: [BridgeStatusModel]
    var score: Double = 0.0 // computed
}

@Observable
class AppStateModel {
    var routes: [RouteModel] = []
    var isLoading: Bool = false
    var selectedRouteID: String?
}
```

Use `@ObservationIgnored` for any internal cache or timestamp fields that shouldn't trigger view updates.

See [Documentation/OnDeviceTrainingRobustness.md](Documentation/OnDeviceTrainingRobustness.md) for detailed implementation guide and workflow diagrams.

## withObservationTracking (Selective Reactivity)

For performance hotspots:

```swift
withObservationTracking {
    renderRouteList(model.routes) // only track .routes, not .isLoading
} onChange: {
    print("Routes changed")
}
```

Use this in long-lived views (e.g. route map updates) to avoid over-refreshing.

## UI Binding Example (SwiftUI)

```swift
struct RouteListView: View {
    @Bindable var state: AppStateModel

    var body: some View {
        List(state.routes, id: \.routeID) { route in
            Text("Route \(route.routeID): Score \(route.score)")
        }
    }
}

#Preview("Route List") {
    RouteListView(state: AppStateModel())
}
```

Avoid `@StateObject`, `@ObservedObject`, or Combine. Instead, use `@Bindable` (Observation-compliant) and bind to `@Observable` models.

## Macro Compliance

| Macro | Purpose | Usage |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `@Observable` | Core binding macro | Applied to all state/data models |
| `@ObservationIgnored` | Opt-out of observation | Applied to internal-only fields |
| `withObservationTracking` | Fine-grained change tracking | Applied around view rendering or side-effects |
| `@ViewBuilder` | UI composition | Custom view initializers and helper methods |
| `@MainActor` | Thread safety | UI-impacting service and view-model methods |

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
xcodebuild -project Bridget.xcodeproj -scheme Bridget -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro' test

# Run specific test suite
xcodebuild -project Bridget.xcodeproj -scheme Bridget -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro' test -only-testing:BridgetTests/BridgeDecoderTests

# Run Core ML training tests
xcodebuild -project Bridget.xcodeproj -scheme Bridget -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro' test -only-testing:BridgetTests/CoreMLTrainingTests

# Run data validation tests
xcodebuild -project Bridget.xcodeproj -scheme Bridget -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro' test -only-testing:BridgetTests/DataValidationTests
```

### Debug Logging
For enhanced debugging during development, enable the `TEST_LOGGING` flag:

1. **In Xcode**: Go to BridgetTests target → Build Settings → Other Swift Flags → Add `-DTEST_LOGGING`
2. **Command Line**: Add `OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS="-DTEST_LOGGING"` to xcodebuild commands

**When to Enable**:
- Debugging date parsing issues
- Investigating JSON decoding failures
- Working on data processing pipeline
- Debugging Core ML training issues

**When to Disable**:
- Normal test runs (reduces noise)
- CI/CD pipelines
- Performance testing
